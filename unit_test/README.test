# DAL3IBIS contains two sample programs, which are built whith the library:
#
#   samplec
#   samplef90
#
# to illustrate some DAL3IBIS functionalities. To test these executables,
# you have to:
#
#   - untar the test_data.tar tar file:
#         tar xvf test_data.tar
#
#   - launch the samplec OR samplef90 executable with some arguments, e.g.:
#         ./samplec 'test_data/og_l2.fits[1]' 0 1 11
#
# See DAL3IBIS User's Manual for a description of the meaning of the parameters
#
# You can run these test programs by executing this file.
# It will check for the existence of "samplec" and "samplef90"
# and prepare the test data .
# Finally, it prints a summary indicating whether the execution
# succeeded or not.
#
# You can disable the output of the programs to make the testing
# easier by passing '--quiet' or '-q' as an argument to this script.
#
# You can disable execution of the C program or of the F90 program
# by passing '--c-only' or '-c', or '--f90-only' or '-f' respectively.
#
# You can compare the result with the 'sample.result' file
