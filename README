******************************************************************************

The ISDC Data Access Layer 3 - IBIS (DAL3IBIS) is an ANSI C library, with
Fortran 90 bindings, whose aim is to help Instrument Team developpers in
manipulating the ISDC data structures. DAL3IBIS is a layer on top of DAL and
DAL3GEN, and it is therefore very important to understand the basic concepts of
DAL before using DAL3IBIS.

DAL3IBIS 3.5 is the last major release of DAL3IBIS. Version 3.5.x are "minor"
releases, i.e. bug fixes. When "x" is a multiple of 5, then it means that
a new version of the User Manual has been produced.

DAL3IBIS has been tested on SUN/Solaris 8 (sparc and i386; SUN Forte 6 C and
F90 (sparc only) compilers) and on Linux (gcc 2.95.2 C compiler and Fujitsu
F95 Express F90 compiler). Support is very limited on other platforms.

To build DAL3IBIS 3.5.5, The ISDC Support Software version >= 3.1 is required
In addition, DAL must be upgraded to version 1.4.9 at least!

For Fortran 90 users only: the type INTEGER(KIND=8) must be supported.
Fortran 90 is however optional, and DAL3IBIS can be installed without it

See the Support Software README to build the DAL3IBIS library together with
the Support Software or the DAL3IBIS User Manual in case of upgrade.

Executables using DAL3IBIS must be linked with DAL3IBIS (libdal3ibis.a),
DAL3GEN (libdal3gen.a), DAL (libdal.a) and cfitsio (libcfitsio.a) in order to
work. Please make sure that your makefiles incorporate these libraries in the
following order:
      -ldal3ibis -ldal3gen -ldal -lciftsio

Additionally, all programs using DAL3IBIS directly should include the header
file dal3ibis.h (for C code) or the DAL3IBIS interface module (for F90 code).

Documentation for DAL3IBIS is included in the dal3ibis.ps file which is
included with this distribution.

Two sample programs (in C and in F90) are built together with the library.
See or execute the files 'TESTING' and 'TESTING.ica' for more
information.

DAL3IBIS is under strict Configuration Control since Support Software
version 2.0. It means that even the developer of DAL3IBIS cannot fix a
bug, add or modify a functionality without the approval of ISDC
Configuration Control Board. If you find a bug in DAL3IBIS, please fill
a Software Problem Report on ISDC web pages. Alternatively, if
you wish that some functionality is added or modified, please fill a
Software Change Request on ISDC web pages.

All files containing "ica" in their names are part of the ICA subsystem for
IBIS, and have been developed by L.Lerusse. Development and testing of this part 
of DAL3IBIS are under his responsin\bility, while integration and deliveries is
done by S.Paltani.  


All files containing "calib" in their names are part of the IBIS calibation, 
and have been developed. Development and testing of this part
